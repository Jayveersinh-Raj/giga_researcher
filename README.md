### âœ¨ A literature analysis tool that will help researchers study articles and write code faster.
### It is powered by [GigaChat](https://developers.sber.ru/docs/ru/gigachat/overview) and [GigaChain](https://github.com/ai-forever/gigachain). 

## How to use it
### ðŸ‘‰There are 2 retrievers, one is `arxiv` search and the other is `web crawl`.
### ðŸ‘‰Both generates reports according to the asked question, or given prompt along with `url references` for `web crawl`, and `paper titles` for `arxiv`.
### ðŸ‘‰Additionally there is a `custom link search` that takes in a `url`, and lets the user query the url to generated report based on the question or given prompt. This also includes code links from github.
