### âœ¨ A literature analysis tool that will help researchers study articles and write code faster.
### 
### ðŸ˜Ž It is powered by [GigaChat](https://developers.sber.ru/docs/ru/gigachat/overview) and [GigaChain](https://github.com/ai-forever/gigachain). 



## âœ¨ How to use it
### ðŸ‘‰There are 2 retrievers, one is `arxiv` search and the other is `web crawl`.
### ðŸ‘‰Both generates reports according to the asked question, or given prompt along with `URL references` for `web crawl`, and `paper titles` for `arxiv`.
### ðŸ‘‰Additionally there is a `custom link search` that takes in a `URL`, and lets the user query the URL to generate a report based on the question or given prompt. This also includes code links from Git Hub.

## âœ¨ Code structure and installations for `arxiv` and `web` search
### Install all the dependencies using `requirements.txt` by navigating to the parent directory, and creating a virtual environment (if needed).
    pip install -r requirements.txt
### ðŸ’»`arxiv_search_git` &rarr; Contains the files to run the arxiv retriever along with GitHub repo links. The `github_retrieve` directory, handles the github part of the agent. `main.py` is the entry point. Navigate to the directory `arxiv_search_git` and run the following:
    python main.py
### ðŸ’»`web_search_git` &rarr; Contains the files to run the web retriever along with GitHub repo links. The `github_retrieve` directory, handles the github part of the agent. `main.py` is the entry point. Navigate to the directory `web_search_git` and run the following:
    python main.py    

### âœ¨ Now it'll be hosted on the local machine, go to the route below, which is the default:
    http://localhost:8000/giga_research/playground/
### ðŸ“– Note: Both the arxiv and web search should be hosted on the same address, hence, either change the ports or use them separately. Also, put your own `GITHUB` and `GIGACHAIN` API keys in `secret_key.env`.

## âœ¨ Code structure and installations for `custom link search`
### Install all the dependencies using `requirements.txt` by navigating to the parent directory, and creating a virtual environment (if needed).
    pip install -r requirements.txt
### `main.py` is the entry point. Navigate to the directory `custom_link_search` and run the following:
    python main.py    

### âœ¨ Now it'll be hosted on the local machine, go to the route below, which is the default:
    http://localhost:4000/research-assistant/playground/
### ðŸ“– Note: Put your own `GITHUB` and `GIGACHAIN` API keys in `secret_key.env`. This service would be hosted on `port:4000`, hence can be simultaneously used with `arxiv` or `web` agent.
